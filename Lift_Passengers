--QUESTION

Write an sql query that produces comma seperated list of passengers who can be accomodated in each lift without exceeding the 
lifts capacity. The passengers in the lift should be ordered by their weight in ascending order.



--SOLUTION

select id, string_agg(pasenger_name, ' , ') as passengers
from (
	select b.*, a.capacity_kg,
	sum(weight_kg) over(partition by b.id order by b.id, weight_kg) as cum_sum
	from lift as a
	join lift_passengers as b on a.id = b.id
	order by b.id, weight_kg
	) as a
where cum_sum < capacity_kg
group by id
